# height-measuring-app

If you were like me in childhood whenever I saw a tall tree or building I used to imagine how tall the tree is?
So, I made a web app using javascript to measure the height of any thing. This app uses basic triangulation equation implimented using javascript. 

## How to use it-

1.Add the distance between you and the object using the slider provided.
2.Hold the phone perpendicular to the ground and tilt your camera till you reach the top of the object.

## Where can it be used??

Can be used in wood cutting industry as measuring the thickness of a tree is easy using a measuring tape but calculating the height is not. So this app can be used to measure the height and decide which tree to cut on requirement reducing wastage.


### This app does not give you the most accurate height but can give you the rough theoritical idea of it.
